This is a prototype of OpenAI function calling with GPT 4 Turbo. [The code behind this prototype](https://github.com/skylar-anderson/openai-chat-playground) is rather simple.  The model is provided a list of retrieval functions, and when prompted, is allowed to recursively call these functions until there is sufficient context to answer the user's question. 

### How to use this prototype:

- Messages are stored in your browser. Clear the conversation by refreshing or clicking the clear button
- Use the input below to start a conversation with Copilot
- On the right, you'll see the functions called by the model. Click on a function to reveal the raw response body and function schema
- Click on the cog icon in the top left to modify settings

### Try it`;

const examples = [
  `what are you?`,
  `summarize the last 3 changes to vercel/ai`,
  `search for all important files related to the Dialog component on primer/react, then retrieve the last commit for each file, then summarize the diff associated with that commit`,
  `summarize comments on the last 3 pull requests to primer/react`,
  `search hackernews and summarize sentiment for vercel and their role in AI development. Then look at the first 3 pages of issues in verce/ai and help me prioritize 3 new milestones.`,
  `In as much detail as possible, summarize the intent behind pr #4035 in primer/react. If possible, use any related issues to find the answer.`,
  `help me select a good first issue with primer/react
  then, use code search to find the most relevant files related to this issue. Then, write 3 suggestions for how I should get started on this issue. Be specific and use code examples.`,
